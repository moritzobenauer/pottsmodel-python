**Performing the *Wang Landau Algorithm* for the *Q-State Potts 
Model* on a two-dimensional square lattice.**


## Theoretical Background

> [!NOTE]
> The **Wang Landau algorithm** [^1] [^2] estimates the density of states (DOS) by performing random moves, updating probabilities based on energy changes, and iteratively flattening a histogram. It allows uniform energy space sampling, facilitating accurate thermodynamic property calculations over various temperatures, overcoming limitations of traditional *Monte Carlo* methods dependent on specific temperatures. The **Potts model** [^3] is a generalization of the Ising model in statistical mechanics. It describes interacting spins on a lattice, where each spin can be in one of [0,Q) states. The model is used to study phase transitions, critical phenomena, and various problems in condensed matter physics and materials science.

## How to use

```bash
python main.py -g 10 -f example -z 0.8 -m 0.001 -n 100 -q 2
```

## Thermodynamic Results

### Ising Model (Q=2)
For the $Q=2$ case a second order phase tranisition can be observed. The vertical line indicates the analytical *Onsager* solution.[^4] The label *HI* indicated that only the energy interval [-2;0] was sampled and then mirrored. The results match thermodynamic calculations reported in the literature.[^2]

### Higher Order (Q=8)
For the $Q=8$ case a first order phase tranisition can be observed. The results match thermodynamic calculations reported in the literature.[^2]

## Known bugs and To-Do's

> [!WARNING]
> - Implement proper energy boundaries (upper and lower energy limits for proper sampling). This currently leads to a small inconsistency at $E=-1.0$ for the $Q=8$ case.
>
>- Parallelization
>- Include calculations for order parameter depending on the temperature
